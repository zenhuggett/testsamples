## about this project
*This is a mockup of the final project for COMP 122*
The plan is to add to this project at key points throughout the semester. The final result is an interactive performance system that incudes sampled sounds, beat patterns, short sequences, and a music generator. 

Each of these components will function with the others. Detailed instructions are embedded in each section of this app. Further instructions, resources, and guides are available on Sakai.
